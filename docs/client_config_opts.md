If a client requests topic metadata after manual topic creation but before the topic has been fully propagated to the broker the client is requesting metadata from, the topic will seem to be non-existent and the client will mark the topic as such, failing queued produced messages with `ERR__UNKNOWN_TOPIC`. This setting delays marking a topic as non-existent until the configured propagation max time has passed. The maximum propagation time is calculated from the time the topic is first referenced in the client, e.g., on produce(). <br>*Type: integer*                                 |

The fallback broker version will be used for `api.version.fallback.ms`. Valid values are: 0.9.0, 0.8.2, 0.8.1, 0.8.0. Any other value >= 0.10, such as 0.10.2.1, enables ApiVersionRequests. <br>*Type: string*                                                                                                  |

The broker must also be configured with `auto.create.topics.enable=true` for this configuration to take effect. Note: the default value (true) for the producer is different from the default value (false) for the consumer. Further, the consumer default value is different from the Java consumer (true), and this property is not supported by the Java producer. Requires broker version >= 0.11.0.0, for older broker versions only the broker configuration applies. <br>*Type: boolean*                                                                                                                                                |
