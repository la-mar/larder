The transactional.id is used to identify the same transactional producer instance across process restarts. It allows the producer to guarantee that transactions corresponding to earlier instances of the same producer have been finalized prior to starting any new transactions, and that any zombie instances are fenced off. If no transactional.id is provided, then the producer is limited to idempotent delivery (if enable.idempotence is set). Requires broker version >= 0.11.0. <br>*Type: string*                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

If this value is larger than the `transaction.max.timeout.ms` setting in the broker, the init_transactions() call will fail with ERR_INVALID_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT. The transaction timeout automatically adjusts `message.timeout.ms` and `socket.timeout.ms`, unless explicitly configured in which case they must not exceed the transaction timeout (`socket.timeout.ms` must be at least 100ms lower than `transaction.timeout.ms`). This is also the default timeout value if no timeout (-1) is supplied to the transactional API methods. <br>*Type: integer* |

The following configuration properties are adjusted automatically (if not modified by the user) when idempotence is enabled: `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=5` (must be less than or equal to 5), `retries=INT32_MAX` (must be greater than 0), `acks=all`, `queuing.strategy=fifo`. Producer instantation will fail if user-supplied configuration is incompatible. <br>*Type: boolean*                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| compression.type      | P   | none, gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd          |              none | medium     | Alias for `compression.codec`: compression codec to use for compressing message sets. This is the default value for all topics, may be overridden by the topic configuration property `compression.codec`.  <br>*Type: enum value*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| compression.level     | P   | -1 .. 12                               |                -1 | medium     | Compression level parameter for algorithm selected by configuration property `compression.codec`. Higher values will result in better compression at the cost of more CPU usage. Usable range is algorithm-dependent: [0-9] for gzip; [0-12] for lz4; only 0 for snappy; -1 = codec-dependent default compression level. <br>*Type: integer*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
